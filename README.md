# New-Solar-Language
Successor of the Solar programming language I previously worked on.

compiler2 was the second attempt at writing this compiler, which finally got past the parsing stage but had several issues.

compiler3 will be the continuation with a (hopefully) better structure for the AST and symbol table, which should hopefully result in a functional compiler to assembly.

documentation2 is the new documentation for the language, adding new features and clarifying more things.
